      <br />
      I’ve been writing HTML since the 90’s, CSS since the 00’s, and JavaScript
      since the 10’s. I’ve kept pace with the tools and frameworks of the modern
      web and love building great-looking, responsive and reactive, full stack
      applications.

    <h3>Skilled Value</h3>
    <p>
      My specialty is being a strong link between design thinking and code
      engineering. My unique value comes from knowing the language and values of
      design teams, product developers, and the users they deliver to, and
      engineering the code that makes them real. My years experience with
      Semantic HTML, advanced CSS, and myriad JavaScript tools help me move
      fluidly from ideas to implementations. My empathy for stakeholders at
      every level helps make happy developers, designers, product managers, and
      users.
    </p>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>
      A designer at heart, I am perpetually curious and exploring new ideas, and
      creative projects. Currently I'm digging deeply into blockchain
      technology, smart contract development, and DApp UX.<br />
      <br />
      I'm also a musician, veggie gardener, and graphic artist.
    </p>
    <h3>Teaching / Tutoring</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a code bootcamp grad and career-changer, so I like to help others
      learn code and get started in the industry. I’ve been a teaching assistant
      and lead instructor for full-stack JavaScript bootcamps and University of
      Washington’s Continuum College for continuing education.<br />
      <br />
      I provide one-on-one tutoring to students of front-end web development. If
      you are looking for help navigating all the new ideas and nuances of HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript, <a href="mailto:kphyde@gmail.com">get in touch</a>!
