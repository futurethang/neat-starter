Hi, thanks for popping by!

Full disclosure, I've never been much of a 'blogger', but it's nice to know I have this corner of the internet available if I need to share my thoughts or hash out any ideas I am chewing on. 

For the sake of relevancy, this blog will likely keep a focus on the more professional aspects of my goings on. Front End web development, UX design and engineering, and the unique challenges of developing for decentralized web applications. 

Shit who am I kidding, I might drop some music or cooking related posts every once in a while. Better than nothing eh?

That's it. Stay healthy ‚úåüèº
