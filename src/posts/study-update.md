This idea of a self-guided study program so far lacks structure, but I think at a minimal level, I can take log of the 'lessons' I've engaged with so far. It's a way to review and keep track of the articles / videos I've focused on, and even showcase a bit of the products of my effort. 

## UX Study

I started listening to Laura Klein's podcast, [What Is Wrong With UX](https://www.usersknow.com/podcast). I can't claim to be an avid Podcast listener, but the candid takes and shorter episodes makes this an actually fun and informative one I can actually enjoy. 

## Drawing

OK this will probably help career stuff one way or another, but more so I just enjoy drawing abstract things and odd characters. Why not keep that skill on the ups?
