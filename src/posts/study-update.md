This idea of a self-guided study program so far lacks structure, but I think at a minimal level, I can take log of the 'lessons' I've engaged with so far. It's a way to review and keep track of the articles / videos I've focused on, and even showcase a bit of the products of my effort. 

## UX Study

I started listening to Laura Klein's podcast, [What Is Wrong With UX](https://www.usersknow.com/podcast). I can't claim to be an avid Podcast listener, but the candid takes and shorter episodes makes this an actually fun and informative one I can actually enjoy. 

## Drawing

OK this will probably help career stuff one way or another, but more so I just enjoy drawing abstract things and odd characters. Why not keep that skill on the ups?

This is a bit more in depth than I am at the moment, but it's always great to see an artist's process from start to finish. It's entertaining, and I can usually glean some high level tips, but I don't think I'm anywhere near this depth.

Now this is much more rudimentary. Typically I might now really be interested in a video like this, but in the interest of treating my time like a studio curriculum, it's great to re visit and dive deep into core basics.

Despite feeling like this was an odd thing to spend too much time on, I like some of the results I got!

## Animation

Again with the basics . . . these are all ideas that I "know already", but man is it good to have a concrete, concise breakdown of the principals.

In fact I put these ideas to use immediately on some really quick and crude animations, and they are already far better than previous tries where these principles just were not fresh in my head.

These are all really simple things. Simple concepts, simple elements, simple exercises. But if this is the outset of a fresh attempt at schooling myself, what better place to begin? These feel like really easy wins, and that's exactly what I want to compound on for the coming weeks, months, and years.
