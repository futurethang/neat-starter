  being all around alright. Can I set meaningful and ambitious enough education
  goals for myself without needing to enroll in traditional curiculum?

I'm at a bit of a comfortable rut career wise. I pivoted from tech services to web development about 3 years ago, and the return on investment from bootcamp education and effort to get a foot in the door is astounding. I went in with plenty of professional experience and a bachelors degree in design, so I had plenty leg up to land decent opportunities, but all in all it's been like a 10 year career leap in less than half the time.

Over the couple years following training, I worked on some large front end projects, writing code and providing some designer's eye. Eventually I landed with a small crypto startup where I'm a front end developer, however almost in title only. Pivoting to new needs that come up in a small growing outfit has pulled me in new directions, and my weekly developing hours are basically nil.

But it's given me a lot of designer opportunities, and this is a direction that feels almost like a homecoming after nearly 2 decades since finishing my bachelors. It's a different arena than what I learned in college, but many of the principles and tools are the same. So while I am able to be the teams leader on design and UX and UI development, I'm still learning as I go - a context that makes for a rewarding job! 

Beyond the deliverables that keeps this project moving forward, I have room to reach. In other words, I'm at a good enough spot that I need to engage a little extra effort, like when attending school alongside work for an extended period. Last time I did this in earnest was a 6 month JavaScript bootcamp program, logging 3 days of class and 10-15 hours of homework each week. It was confounding and grueling at times, but led to great outcomes.

I'm considering what that would mean for me now. I have the appetite for deeper learning that will help me be more competent and confident in my career. However I do not have the appetite for a big financial expense to enroll in a major program. What I want is to self guide my way through some materials and exercises that culminate in more or less a masters program in modern design.

I'll just stop there, because that is such a loaded and clearly foolish "goal", but a good starting place to find what the definition might actually be, and learn a lot along the way. I hope that writing about it will give me some chronicle to check my progress and lead me on some sort of path, so I'll try to keep hashing this idea out in the coming weeks and put a clearer definition on it.
