I'm sure this is insulting to anyone who actually put up the time and money and effort to get a bonafide Masters degree of any sort, but they'll just have to bear with me as I improvise the process. I did in fact look over some curricula of major Masters of Design programs (Harvard, University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon) to get ideas, maybe clues on reading materials or whatever. They look like very interesting, challenging programs, but with a heavy academic bend.

Nothing wrong with that, but I'm unsure that is the best direction for me at the moment. I am interested in the Big Ideas of design, and hope to include a lot of that in my reading, but I'm feeling much more interested in hands-on application. So for me, right now, it's about Mastering my Craft more than anything.

I'd like to say that narrows it down nicely, but it's still quite broad. And breadth is a bit liberating too! It makes this feel much more like a studio arts program, with a focus on the tools and techniques for very tangible skills development. Compliment that with readings that come from the theoretical or applied practices, and there's a lot of upside. It also leaves some room for indulging in more not-career-based skills growth, like drawing, painting, animation. I want to spend more time developing my own art and style.

So a good place to leave my thoughts today is, lean heavily into the craft skills. Put new techniques into practice to achieve more diversity of effects and end results, and collect efficiency and organization techniques as well as aesthetic techniques. Being able to work faster with fewer headaches is a million dollar proficiency (with a lot of room for improvement, if I'm being honest).
