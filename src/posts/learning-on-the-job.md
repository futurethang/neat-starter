I been meaning to check in with the self-guided design education project of mine, but a spat of travel and increased work sorta put that initiative in the background. June is getting stacked really quickly!

So one way to look at that is to feel kinda bad about myself that I set a (admittedly vague) goal and kinda let it slip, like so many other grandiose plans that fizzle and fade. And there might be a little truth to that.

But on the other hand, I've been pretty heavily engaged in many of the exact things I aim to improve just through the day to day necessities of work. 

We're heading to a hackathon event in late June and will be one of the pillar sponsors. This is great, and I'm excited to go, but it has created a big crunch time to get all our visual elements ready in time. Shit like the booth items, banner and tablecloth graphics, merch, and lots of video content for a display. With less than a month runway, I had to really hunker down on several projects across different media and vendors, and I gotta try to keep that all cohesive so we got a gelling brand presence.

I won't get into the details, but pulling this off has offered me a lot of deep dive into managing my shared graphic assets across the Adobe ecosystem, so that depending on the end product (t-shirt, video, POAP NFT, etc) I am applying our logos and design elements across Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects.

That's been a great exercise in keeping a larger collection organized and consistent. It's required me to call up lots of new techniques to get the results I want, like a stamp effect for the POAP. Most of all it's been an awesome opportunity to spend a lot of time with After Effects, learning loads of new tricks and workflow improvements.

That's kinda been my big takeaway from the perspective of learning and growing new skills as I might have in a self-guided school perspective. I dive deepest when I have a tangible deliverable and hard deadlines. That's very difficult to enforce autonomously so having it come through work is actually a bit of a blessing.
